### Prerequisites:
- Built with Unreal Engine 5.1, Supports up to 5.6
- Requires atleast one API key from either OpenAI, Google, XAI, Anthropic, Alibaba, Moonshot AI, Deepseek or Bytedance.
- Requires one of the Paid Plugins to work, [GenAI for Unreal](https://www.fab.com/listings/68e7f092-1fea-4e6d-8d31-c6b96b06a02e) or <coming soon>
- This project will be automatically stripped into two separate projects, one blueprint only and one Cpp+Blueprint, and then it will be compiled and packaged to EACH unreal version from 5.1 to 5.6 or above. All this will be done by the CI/CD pipeline, so you don't have to worry about it.
